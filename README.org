       ./trm {--commit|--rollback[=1]}
#+end_example

(...)

* Build from source

First, ensure the source tree is absolutely clean. It's recommended this command to be issued prior to each compilation; do not rely on the source tree being clean after cloning the repository or after un-tarring:

#+begin_src sh
make mrproper
#+end_src

To build ~trm~, issue the following command:

#+begin_src sh
make
#+end_src
